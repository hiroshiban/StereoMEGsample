[about this experiment]

Slant3D_MEG, slant3d_display.m, and slant3d_stimulus_**.m
- Slanted planes are presented (one-shot per trial to measure MEG responses related to hierarchical processing of depth).
- The gradient angles are one of -52.5, -37.5, -22.5, -7.5, 7.5, 22.5, 37.5, 52.5 degs (slanted from the horizontal line).
- task: discriminating which direction the target (circular object) is slanted. (key 1: top-near, key 2: top-far).
- Each run will take about 10 mins
- Totally, (8 slant conditions x 3 mask types ('no mask', 'xy mask', and 'z mask') - 4 duplicated condtions) x 240 repetitions
- The whole session can be completed around 8 hours
